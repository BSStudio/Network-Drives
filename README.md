# Network-Drives

A really simple C# program for mapping network drives.

You can open the project in Visual Studio.

Search for `TODO` in the code and do not forget to give the Samba login username and password to the given variables.

Build the program and use the .exe file for the network drive mapping.

Advantage over the `net use` commands is that it maps the drives for admins as well because it always runs in the current users context.
